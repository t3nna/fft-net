## implementing a simple FTP server using Node.js with the net and fs modules:

1. Define the server requirements: Start by defining the requirements for the FTP server, including which FTP commands
should be implemented and how the server should handle client connections and file operations.

Initialize the project: Create a new Node.js project and install the net and fs modules using npm.

Create the TCP server: Use the net module to create a TCP server that listens on a specific port and accepts incoming
client connections. When a client connects to the server, the server should send a welcome message to the client.

Implement basic FTP commands: Using the fs module, implement basic FTP commands such as LIST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. The
LIST command should list the files in the server's file system, the GET command should download a file from the server
to the client, the PUT command should upload a file from the client to the server, and the DELETE command should delete
a file from the server's file system.

Handle client requests: When a client sends an FTP command to the server, the server should parse the command and
execute the appropriate file operation using the fs module. The server should then send a response to the client
indicating whether the operation was successful or not.

Implement authentication: FTP servers typically require authentication to prevent unauthorized access to files. You can
implement a simple username/password authentication scheme using a JSON file or a database to store user credentials.

Implement error handling: FTP clients can encounter errors during file operations, such as a file not found error or a
permission denied error. The server should handle these errors gracefully and send an appropriate response to the
client.

Test the server: Once the server is implemented, test it thoroughly using various FTP clients, such as FileZilla or
WinSCP. Verify that all implemented FTP commands work as expected and that the server handles errors correctly.

Deploy the server: Finally, deploy the FTP server to a production environment, such as a cloud server or a dedicated
server, and configure it to run as a service so that it can start automatically on boot. Ensure that the server is
properly secured and that client connections are encrypted using SSL/TLS.
